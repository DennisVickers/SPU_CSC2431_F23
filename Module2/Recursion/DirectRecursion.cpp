Explanation:
Base Cases:
If n is 0, the function returns 0.
If n is 1, the function returns 1.
These base cases handle the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence 
and ensure that the recursion eventually terminates.
Recursive Case:
For n â‰¥ 2, the function returns the sum of the two preceding Fibonacci numbers. This is calculated by making recursive calls to fibonacciRecursive(n - 1) 
and fibonacciRecursive(n - 2).

Main Function:
The main function calls fibonacciNonTailRecursive with num set to 10. 
This computes the 10th Fibonacci number and stores it in result.
